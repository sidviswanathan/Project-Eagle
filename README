# Very critical cron job running on Google App Engine (Heroku does not support crons every minute)
# Every minute, this cron called an endpoint in this code base which fetches available tee time data from Deep Cliff Golf Course
# The cron hits the following URL -> http://www.presstee.com/server_communication/update_courses (passes in course id)
# Code running on App Engine is in Python, main files are main.py, dc.py, and cron.yaml 
# class Pinger(IHandler): is the class method that pings the URL every minute
# For more details, visit Google App Engine Wiki
